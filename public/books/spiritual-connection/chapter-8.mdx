this chapter is about the bond between a guru and disciple

when nanda maharaj was going to bath in the river yamuna, before the end of ekadashi. a villager has warned him about the danger in entering yamuna in the evening. but in the end nanda maharaja ended up going into the river. 

a servant of varundev, who was the controller of the river yamuna - had captured nanda maharaja and bought him to varundev. he had thought he has done a very good deed by capturing someone who broke the rules and he will be rewared very happily by his master. 

this news came to krishna and balaram and they reached the court of varun dev. when varundev saw nanda maharaj, he immediately apologised for the actions of his servant and glorified him. 

he later freed nanda maharaj.

the moral of the story is that the servant failed to understand the mind of his master - and thought of external rewared when he captured nanda maharaj. 

at every step of our way in bhakti, we are always representing our master. for every action of ours in spiritual life, the results also goes to the guru. 

if we do something bad - people will blame our guru or the organisation that we are linked to. thus, we should always conduct ourselves with good behaviour and protect our guru - not physically but his grace, his image by our behaviour.

the guru and disciple share an internal spiritual bond. when the bond is strong, the both can understand each others heart without even saying anything. 

and the guru, when accepts a disciple also shares the karmic burden of the disciple which are the sinful activities of the disciple so that the disciple can carry his spiritual life with ease. but this also makes our guru suffer because of our sins. but he takes the burden anyway so that we can progress in our spiritual life. 

he only takes on the burden if the spiritiual connection is strong and we are surrendered to his shelter and are determined towards our bhakti. 

but we should not misuse the kindness, if we keep in doing those sinful activities after a strong bond with the guru and the guru taking the burden of our sinful activities - then we might get in trouble when the guru realises this. our guru will stop taking responsibility of us as we keep moving away from his shelter.

one way of making the bond strong is to follow the teachings and instructions of the guru - there was one example from the book which says - in a classroom, the students behave obidiently and listens to him. but when he leaves, the mischeavous ones show their true colors but the obidient ones, keep revising what was being taught and finish the assignments given by the teacher.

in the case of bhakti, it is the same. we should always follow the instructions given by the guru - and upon completing the instructing and following the teaching, the bond gets stronger and it is only in the guru's absence, our true test of bhakti happens.

the chapter also discusses about a managerial relationship with our guru, where we only discuss about tasks/things that needs to be executed, results of those tasks etc. we should do that but we should not lose our main goal - bhakti. 

we should always discuss about bhakti whenever we meet our guru, and make sure that we work on that thing which was discussed in the previous meeting which would help is progress in bhakti.

management is important, but when our sadhna is strong - it becomes automatically easy.

---
from this chapter - I have learned the importance our conducting ourselves both when we are in association with devotees or when we are not. because in both the places, we are representing both - guru and krishna. 

so i will focus on my behaviour.

another is to keep the connection strong - we should follow the given instructions and keep on those promises which were made. I will make sure I will do my mala regularly and send message. 

i will always discuss about bhakti and discuss about problems that are being an obstacle.
