this is the story of the fall down of indra and the demigods.

since brihaspati (indra's spirtual master) was daily coming into the court of demigods, they starteted seeing him as their own equal. and they stopped giving him the respect. they had forgoten of his portistion as their spiritual master. 

on the other hand, the demons who waged a war with the demigods..took the blessings of their guru sukracharya and became really powerful. the demigods, on the other side were the weaker party because the didnt have the blessings of their guru.

lord indra had to go the lord bramha for help, bramha explained him about the importance of the mercy of the guru and guided the demigods to victory in the end.

we tend to forget our position is nothing without the blessings and mercy of our spiritual master, and we should be always grateful for it. a guru saves us from all of our miseries and brings us to the right path. he saves us from this ocean and he comes in a boat to pick us up.

sometimes, our guru might be playful or become too familiar with us (or it can be even a test) but we should never become familiar or consider him on our level and forget about our position. he is said to be the representatives of all the demigods. even lord krishna tells us to consider the guru as him only.

there was also a story of madhavendra puri who gave prema bhakti to everyone. he had two disciples, isvara puri and ramchandra puri. isvara puri was a very obidient and humble disciple and always followed the instructions of his guru and behaved very nicely with everyone. whereas, ramchandra puri, was always jealous of his god brother and always disobeyed the orders. so people cursed him more and more.

it was said in the chapter that our good karma follows us everywhere but it is also true for our sins. so we should be very careful.

when madhavendra puri was at his last stages of life, iswvara puri took up the service of taking care of his guru, he would clean his urine and stool. he was not disgusted by it or he didnt feel bored doing the service everyday. he was doing that selflessly only for the happiness of his guru. in the end he recived the blessings of guru and krishna and he was so humble that lord chatanya became his disciple.

this lesson taught me the importance of the mercy of our guru, without which we are nothing. and we should always make our guru happy and not forget our postition as a disciple.
