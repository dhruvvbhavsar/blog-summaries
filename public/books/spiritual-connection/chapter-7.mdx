this is a story about eklavya.

when eklavya fired the arrows at the dog in the jungle in the night and the pandavs noticed the speed at which they were fired, they were surprised by how precisely the arrows were fired. the tried to find who the person was who fired the arrows and found him. it was eklavya who had practiced archery by worshipping the idol of dronacharya. eklavya told him that he was going to the best archer in the world.

this shocked arjun and the pandavas went back to their guru and narrated what had happend, dronacharya went to eklavya's place and ended up asking for his right thumb as guru dakshina. eklavya was fast enough to follow this instruction and gave his right thumb away. this rendered all of skills and practice useless because he didnt have the thumb to shoot the arrow.

HG Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati thakur tells us how the eklavya mentality is bad. he was worshipping the guru with the wrong intention. he wanted to become the best archer in the world and thats why he wanted to become a disciple of dronacharya. not to serve him and become a krishna concious person. he had his own alterior motives. 

he also tells us that guru dakshina is not something material or some tangible thing that  makes our guru happy, he is happy when we follow the instructions, follow the 4 regulative principles and keep the promises we made with our guru. that is the real dakshina. because he wants us to reach god.

eklavya gave away his thumb not because he was surrendered to his guru, this is not the case. because if he was, then he would have stopped right there when he asked dronacharya to be his guru for the first time. he gave away his thumb spontaneously because he wanted to save his reputation as a disciple and feared the consequences of disobeying for the second time. 

afterall, guru sees our intentions. he knows what we want. if we want something material, like eklavya wanted to be the best therefore he wanted to be a disciple. he wanted his desires get fullfilled which is why he approached dronacharya in the first place. he worshed the idol of droanacharya because he wanted to become the best. it is not the activity or seva which we do helps us progress in bhakti, but how much submissive we are to the other vaishnavs.

dronacharya was also not partial to arjun, he taught the same things to every one of his disciples. but arjun meditated on his teachings and practised whatever he was taught day and night while others were busy pretending to learn. plus, he was also a dear friend of krishna wand very submissive towards him..guru wants only two things from us - follow the instructions and become a devotee of krishna. thats why arjun was the best.

a guru also has a moral duty to impart knowledge to the right person, because knowledge is power and knowledge in the hands of the wrong person was very dangerous. eklavya belonged to a tribe which was against the kuru dynasty and he was assigned the duty of training the royal princes to be the protectors of the kuru dynasty. he was obliged to be partial to the kurus and training eklavya would be against his duty and also against dharma.

regardless of this, he trained drustadrumnya, son of drupad. who was born to kill him. but still he trained him in military science and executed his duty as a guru.

from this chapter, i have learned that we should not be a superficial bhakta. we should only do things which would please our guru and not please out own senses and desires. i will be very aware of this from now on. we are not here to fullfil our desires, we are here to learn and become close to god.
