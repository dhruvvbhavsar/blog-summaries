this was a chapter about the duty of a disciple.

it starts with the story of Maharaja Shantanu, who got attracted to a lady called Satyavati. He ended up asking his hand in marriage, but her father had put a condition that only her son can made to sit on the throne after Maharaj Shantanu.

but he already had a son - Devavrata. he felt devastated.

when devavrata sensed the pain in his father's eyes and came to know about the situation, he took a vow to always remain a bramhachari and never be married.

the demigods really liked this and gave him a name of Bhishma and he was respected.

after this, maharaja shantanu was very pleased with him and gave him iccha - mrityu, which means he can die whenever he wishes to.

this story teaches us about the quality about a first-class disciple like bhishma, who did his duty without being instructed to make his father happy.

this chapter also discusses that our bhakti should not be mixed bhati, eg - 
- karma + bhakti
- gyan + bhakti
- etc

we should perform pure bhakti.

later, it also discusses about the types of disciples.

1. First class disciple
   
   these disciples carry out the instruction, without being instructed. because they know the mind of their spiritual master just so well. it is not by magic, but by constant training and instructions that it becomes natural for the disciple. they are aligned with the principles so well that they can sometimes bend the rules and also stick to the core principles

2. Second class discple
   
   these disciples follow the instructions only after they are given, they follow it very nicely, and they are also very serious about bhakti just like the first class disciples. 

3. Third class disciples
   
   they follow the instructions, but they are need to be reminded repeatedly, and sometimes add their own mind when doing seva.
   
4. Foruth class disciples
   
   they keep on doing the same sinful activities even after being reminded by their guru many times and even after reminding them again and again they fail to follow the guru's order.
   
the chapter also discusses about the story of 3 dolls - 

once upon a time, there a guru was with disciples and one of them asked the guru, amongst all the disciples whom did he love the most? he said that he loved every one equally. but then the disciple argued that since everyone is not on the same level, then their futures would also be different. 

they he said the following story - once he was washing his hands in the river and he had three dolls with him - one made of sugar, one of cloth and the other was stone. 

he said that the one which was made of sugar, immediately melted away. this is like the third class disciple, who after some material pleasure or a chance to enjoy is just take away by maya immediately.

the one made of cloth, melts a little bit away but the the cloth still remains, who is like the second class disciple, that even after many hurdles on like or a chance to enjoy, he might slip away but there will be some amount of bhakti remaining in him and he will know what is right or wrong.

and the doll made of stone, will remain unflinched and nothing will happen to the doll. this is like the first class disciple who remains steady when maya comes to  him. 

and each discple will get the blessings according to they sincierity towards guru and krishna. 


we should all be connected and be helpful to each other when we are in a group of devotees. bhakti is individual, but it is more stronger when collective. it is like a basketball team where the guru is the coach and the devotees are like the players. the guru can only increase the moral of the devotees. but even if one of them is not performing well, then the whole team suffers. and it is the duty of the team members to give the falled devotee moral support when something bad happens to them. as by this the team will get stronger, else too many great players with lack of coordination will only lead to chaos.

the chapter also discusses about a very sensitive topic - `deviant` disciples. which go away or the ones who keep performing sinful activities even after being in a guru disciple bond. the guru has to remain very careful as during initiation, they make a spiritual contract that the guru will take up some of the karmic reactions of the disciple and bear them so the the path of spiritual life becomes easy for the disciple. but if the disciple misuses this blessing then the guru has to suffer badly and take up newly occuring sins of the disciple. 

the end goal of the guru is that the disciple should become pure, because krishna only wants purity. the way that this works is that our guru offers us to their guru and their guru passes it to their guru and so on - it is a parampara. and when we are not pure, our seva is not accepted. so we should make serious efforts of making ourselves pure. 

and when we are trained enough, we should be ready to represent our guru in the real world, because there will come a day when people will judge us/or our actions and judge our guru. so we should conduct ourselves very carefully, follow instructions and become first class disciples. 

---

this chapter taught me the importance of collective bhakti, understanding the types of disciples and what being a first class disciple means and the dangers of taking the instruction lightly as it may lead to guru's suffering. 

i will make sure that i will always help a devotee out when their moral is down and they are in a situation whrere they cannot do bhakti, i will try to be a good disciple and follow the instructions given to me nicely. 

and i will take efforts to be mindful of my activities and behavour when around and not arond people as people will always judge the guru based on it.
