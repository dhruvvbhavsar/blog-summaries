this chapter revolves around guru's chastisement.

raghunath das, who was a member of a very rich household..was trying to run away from his family in search of god and doing service unto him. his parent would lock him up, or keep him guarded. but still, he would try to go out and to find god and try coming to the spiritual path. 

one day, he was able to flee out of his place and saw lord nityananda in the jungle. as soon as the lord saw raghunath, he called him a thief. and said now you have come to see me? I shall punish you.

he was chastised by lord nityananda and he ordered him to arange a festival and feed chippied rice, yoghurt and milk to all of his associates. so raghunath das, claimed this opportunity and arranged a festival to feed all of the village. there were so many people that people were standing in the river where the water flowed till the height of their knees.

lord nitya nanda, being his guru...chastised him, because he was trying to search for krishna. and lord krishna is not directly available..he is only recieved through is pure devotees.

when we are chastised by the guru, it is not done because he hates us or he wants bad for us, infact if you truly care for someone and want to see them succeed, you would appreciate their good but also point them out when it is bad.

similarly, guru chastises us so that we come on the right path and follow the spiritual path nicely. it is only done to correct our mistakes and bring us closer to krishna.

the way to get krishna is not to run after krishna, because he resides in the hearts of his pure devotees. therefore, to get krishna you need to serve the pure devotees and recieve their mercy, then only we get krishna and we need to follow this path.

once, durvasa muni was sent back from vaikuntha because he entered it in the wrong way.

sometimes, guru can be harsh or rude to us when he chastises us. but that is only done sometimes to break our false ego and pride. he tests us and points our wrongs because he wants us to become pure. and only those who are pure can recieve krishna.

in the end, the chapter discusses about forgiveness and restitution. basically, when we do a mistake or do wrong to someone. we should ask for forgiveness and we might even be forgiven, but we should go one step further and make sure that never happens again from our side and take efforts to positvely show that we are repentant of our mistakes. this is restitution. this frees up call the contimation from our hearts and makes us pure.

from this chapter i have learned that being chastised by the guru is a good thing, instead of thinking otherwise. and whenever i am pointed out some mistake, i will not only try to avoid it but also actively work towrds improving in that direction in a positive manner.
