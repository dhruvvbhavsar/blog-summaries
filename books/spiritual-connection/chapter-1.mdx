This chapter starts with the story of lord rama and raja dashrath. after lord rama and laxman were crowned princes, sage vishwamitra muni had come to meet king dashrath. he asked for lord rama to come with him in the jungle as there were many demons that would distrub him and other sages in their spiritual practices and make the area of sacrifice dirty.

the king was surprised that how could such a boy give protection..he enquired with his spiritual master and recvd permission to send rama and laxman to the jungle with vishwamitra muni. in the jungle, the 2 brothers would help the sages fight and get rid of the demons. they brothers continued to do seva of the sages like menial servants and stayed with them.

one day, vishwamitra muni had taken lord rama to mithila where king janak had kept a competetion for swayamwar for his daughter sita. anyone who could lift the bow of lord shiva would get to marry his daughter. many tried and failed. lord rama know that he can lift the bow, but he did not tell or ask his guru if he could take part. he waited for his guru to give him the instruction and recvd blessings from his guru. he won the competetion and was able to marry goddess sita. 

here, he is trying to teach us the we should always obey the guru and follow the instruction and should not try to use our own mind in front of him.

the essence of this chapter is the word surrender. we always tend to shy away from surrendering ourserlves to someone superior. it has a negative vibe to it. but in spiritual terms, we get protection from our spiritual master if we surrender. 

we should open our hearts to the idea of surrender and stay under our guru because he will remove us from the darkness and ignorance and show us the right path. but because of our own insecurities and false ego we do not fully follow the instructions of the guru.

a disciple becomes pure when he follows the instructions given by the guru with devotional service and not just for the sake of doing it. wheenver the guru instructs us, his goal is to keep us in bhakti and come closer towards krishna. and we should always check everytime when we do some seva, if it is giving pleasure to the one who is recving it on the other end. else the service becomes mechanical.

he always mentioned the steps become a disciple - 1. approach a guru 2. Inquire submissively 3. Render service.. the guru gives the instruction based on the capacity of the disciple. 

and the true form of pleasure is acheived not by doing something that makes _us_ happy but when we do something for krishna that makes the guru happy. that is the true form is pleasure.
