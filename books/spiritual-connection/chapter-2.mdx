This chapter tells us a story about lord krishna and his childhood friend sudama. 

one day, rukmini and her maidens were shocked that lord krishna is giving so much respect to a brahman, he was known for treating and respecting brahmans but he never invited them to his chambers. it was none other then his most dearest childhood friend suadama.

they talked about a childhood story of their. when they used to live in their guru's ashram, one day his wife ordered them to bring wood from the forest as it was needed. they went to the forest to get the woods but there was a story and heavy rain. they took shelter under the tree and stay there the whole night. 

when their guru sandipani muni, got the news about them, he came to their rescue. he brought them back to the ashram.

lord krishna is trying to teach us that it is important to accept a guru and live under his shelter. if he wanted, he could have just made the woods appear magically but he followed his duty as a disciple.

we should also follow this path and accept a guru. because he is teaching us what was taught by lord krishna in disciplic succession. just like a ripe fruit is passed down by expert hands.

and by becoming a disciple we become disciplined,  there was an example in the book that says that if we buy and study all the books on medical sciences, we wont become a doctor. similarly, by reading all the vedic books we cannot come on the spiritual path. we need to serve and practice under spiritual master. because he has complete knowledge.

a guru is sent by krishna, which in turn helps us go back to god. and a guru comes when a disciple is ready. 

---
from what i understand, this is for people who are doubtful of accepting a guru and thinking what is a need of a guru if there are so many books already avaiilable. 

i will try to imbibe the quality of humbly accepting the instruction of guru's order just as lord krishna and sudama did. they had faith that whatever happens, their guru will protect them if anything wrong happens. 

because only a guru can save his disciple from all their miseries that keep them away from god.
