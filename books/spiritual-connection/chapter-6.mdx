this is a chapter about love and cooperation.

many ages ago, a king's sons had become of marriagable age. he had asked them to produce nice progeny to continue their lineage. the sons were knows as the pracetas.

upon hearing their father's request, they set out in the jungle and started meditating. but soon after they had arrived at their place of meditation. they started hearing music. actually the place where they were was a place of worship for lord shiva. lord shiva emerged in front of them from the waters. seeing him, they immediately offered obeisances. 

lord shiva was pleased with them and give them a mantra which they later chanted for thousands of wears. ultimately, lord vishnu was pleased with their mediataion and he came down to worship them and give them blessings. when he came, he told them that he was very pleased with their cooperation where all of them a striving for a common goal and then asked them for a boon for whatever they want. 

they ultimately pleased their father, their guru and ultimately lord krishna. this story teaches us that we should do bhakti while cooperating with other devotees. there is no "I" there is "We".

god is never partial to anyone, neither he leaves anyone. he sends a guru when we are ready. but due to our own blindness we cannot see what is god sending in our way. so instead of asking where is god? we should ask ourselves where are we? because god sends us a guru only when we are ready.

there was another story - a blind man was out on the road and wanted to reach a certain place which was far from his village. a cowherd was passing by with his cows. the blind man asked him if he knows the way to that place or if he can take him there. the cowherd replied that he is busy but looking at the blind man's condition, he give him a cow and assured him that she knows the way and will lead him there.

he held on to the tail of the cow and started following her. a few hours passed by but still he hadn't reached the place he wanted to reach. so he got anxious if he's on the right path, so he held on to the tail of the cow with a strong grip, which inturn alarmed the cow. she started running very fast and dragged the blind man which tore his clothes and had him bruised. 

a few people noticed and they thought that he is a thief. so they beat him up thinking that he's a pretender. 

this story was told by srila bhaktisiddhant saraswati thakur - who is trying to tell us that not anyone can lead us to god, and if we associate with a non-bonfide person then we are in for a lot of troubles and miseries.

the chapter also discussed about the power of the instruction of the spiritual master, it also carries the potency execute properly if the disciple has full faith in his guru. there are two such instances - 

1. an illiterate brahman was instructed by his guru to read bhagwad gita every day. so he sat near the entrance of the temple and tried read everyday everyday even tho he didnt understand a single word. other brahmans mocked him. but he did he reading for every day for years. seeing this, one day mahaprabhu was very pleased and he embraced him.
   
2. srila prabhupad, while travelling in train. asked one of his disciples yamuna mataji to prepare hot rice. such a task is considered impossible because how can someone cook rice in the train. but somehow she was able to convice the train conductor and executed the orders perfectly.
   
what this is trying to tell us is that when a guru gives us an instruction, we should be determined and have faith and meditate upon the instruction, because it also carries the potency for us to execute it.

we should also learn to accomodate with different types of people in our spiritual association. because guru tries to bring different types of people into bhakti and should not have a competetive mindset with them. we should help each other grow which also helps us grow. we should love the spiritual family which the guru has made and should not look down on other. bhakti tirtha maharaj said, "look at the person you love the most; now treat every person you see with that love. this is transendance."

this chapter also discussed about being non-envious. because we are all trying to reach golok vrindavan, so to enter that place, we should also behave and act like the people living there. when dhruv maharaj was about to enter the airplane which would take him to golok vrindavan, yamraj came and place his head near the step so that dhruv maharaj can step on it and jump into the airplane.

hes trying to teach a lesson here, that we should be happy to see each other's progress and we should help them to attain that progress. that is a sign of a pure devotee.

---
this chapter taught me the importance of cooperation on bhakti and how important it is to help each other grow without me being envious about it. it taught me the importance of the instruction from the guru. 

i will start looking at everyone with the same level of respect and love as i would for someone close to me and always try to help them whenever possible.

i will always try to execute the instruction of guru without any second thoughts and have full faith in guru and krishna.
