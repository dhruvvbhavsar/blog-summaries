this chapter is about upmanyu and his guru Dhaumya

one day, dhaumya looked at upmanyu and told him that you have been working so much still you are fat. how is it? he replied saying that I support myself through begging. his guru was shocked when heard this, he told him that one should beg for the master..not for himself, and it should be offered to spiritual master first. he obeyed.

after a few days, his guru didnt notice anything different in his body, so he asked upmanyu the same question..to which he replied that he goes for a second begging round to eat. his guru was angry again because there are other brahmans too that support themselves through charity. if he goes for a 2nd round..the householders would not be able to donate to brahmans, so he asked him to stop it. he obeyed again.

same thing happened again, but this time he replied that he was drinking cow's milk. this was repeated a few times and then in the end, because of his uncontrollable hunger..he ended up eating poisonous leaves from the jungle which made him lose his eyesight and then later fell in a well. 

when his guru found him, though he was strict he really cared for him and asked him to pray to ashwini kumars for their help. to which he did by chanting mantras. they appeared before him with a cake which would cure him. but this time he refuse to ate the cake and said that he would need to ask his guru's permission 1st. the ashwini kumars were impressed by his devotion to his guru and tried to test him by saying that the same thing happened to his guru, but his guru when in a similar situation was offered the cake..he ate it.

to which he replied that he is not eligible to measure his gurus actions with his intelligence and whatever situation he is in right now, is because he disobeyed his guru's order. 

the kumar's were impressed and they blessed him and cured him.

this is an important story that teaches us the importance of guru's order. because it is written that the guru is the direct representative of krishna and if we disobey guru's order then we are indirectly disobeying krishna's order. 

and also we must follow the orders with one-pointed-intelligence, without adding anything of our own, the goal here is to please the guru and not ourselves.

sometimes, guru might give us tests or test us in our spiritual practice to check whether we remain still and follow his orders and teachings. and it is written that tests must come, because they help is progress in bhakti. 

this chapter talked about 2 kinds of tests - known tests and surprise tests. known tests help us to prepare to score well in exam. but in life - there are mostly surprise tests. 

but these tests help us prepare for the ultimate exam of life which is death. so tests may come unknowingly in our life that always tests us on our bhakti. and when we face and pass such tests, we only become more confident and stronger in bhakti, so we should always be prepared for such tests, which will always make us pass those tests.

what i learn from this chapter is that we should 
1. follow the order and dont disobey
2. follow the oder with one pointed intelligence 
3. always be prepared for storms in life which keep us away from krishna

I will try to imbibe this qualities unto me.
